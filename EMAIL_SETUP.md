# Email Service Setup Guide

This portfolio uses Resend for email delivery. Follow these steps to set up email functionality:

## 1. Create a Resend Account

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

## 2. Get Your API Key

1. Go to your Resend dashboard
2. Navigate to "API Keys" section
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

## 3. Set Up Domain (Optional but Recommended)

### For Production:
1. Add your domain in Resend dashboard
2. Add the required DNS records
3. Verify domain ownership
4. Update the `from` email addresses in `app/actions.ts`

### For Development:
- You can use the default `onboarding@resend.dev` domain
- Or use any email with your verified domain

## 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

\`\`\`env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
CONTACT_EMAIL=your-email@domain.com
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
\`\`\`

## 5. Update Email Addresses

In `app/actions.ts`, update these email addresses:

\`\`\`typescript
// Replace with your actual email
to: ['your-email@domain.com'],

// Replace with your verified domain
from: 'Portfolio Contact <noreply@yourdomain.com>',
\`\`\`

## 6. Install Dependencies

The Resend package is already included. If you need to install it manually:

\`\`\`bash
npm install resend
\`\`\`

## 7. Test the Contact Form

2. Check your email for the contact notification
3. The sender should receive a confirmation email
